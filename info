            "description": "Titans, in Greek mythology, were the gods of the first generation, born of Gaia and Uranus. There were six brothers (Oceanus, Koi, Krius, Hyperion, Iapetus, Kronos) and six sisters (Tethys, Phoebe, Mnemosyne, Theia, Themis, Rhea). They married each other and gave birth to new gods, including Prometheus, Epimetheus, Atlas, Helios, Selene, Eos, Leto. Uranus sent the most powerful children, Cyclopes and Hecatoncheires, back to the Earth's depths. Suffering greatly, Gaia turned to her Titan sons for help. Only Kronos responded, castrated Uranus, and took his place as supreme deity. Fearing for his power, Kronos swallowed his own children, but Zeus, saved by Rhea, forced him to regurgitate them. The gods, led by Zeus, waged a brutal war with the Titans (Titanomachy) that lasted for ten years. Ultimately, Zeus and the Olympian gods defeated the Titans and cast them into Tartarus."

She is known as an advisor and mentor in the sacred affairs of the second Roman king, Numa Pompilius, the creator of the Roman social and religious system. In some versions, she is represented as the mistress or wife of the king. This myth is a reflection of the widespread ritual of the sacred marriage of the king and the patron goddess of this community. In ancient historiography, since the end of the Republic, the story of Egeria was considered a pious invention of the king in order to successfully pass his laws among the militant and unenlightened crowd of the first Romans. The tsar's meetings with the nymph took place in a grove, which he dedicated to the stone nymphs of the springs, identified with the muses. Egeria was considered one of them. The spring dedicated to her was used by the Vestals, who daily took water there for religious needs. This grove was located near the Capen Gate in the south-east of Rome.In addition, Egeria was worshipped near the city of Aricia, 27 km southeast of Rome, in the grove of Diana their cults subsequently merged. Weeping here from grief after Numa's death, Egeria thereby violated the sacred rites, for which she was turned into a source by Diana Ovid. Metamorphoses. XV. 479-492; 547-551. Perhaps the cult of Egeria in Rome was borrowed from Aricius.Egeria, like Diana and the stones, was also revered as a maternity goddess, whose name, according to the church writer Pavel Deacon, was derived from the verb egero, which means to pull out from the womb."
