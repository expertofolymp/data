            "description": "Titans, in Greek mythology, were the gods of the first generation, born of Gaia and Uranus. There were six brothers (Oceanus, Koi, Krius, Hyperion, Iapetus, Kronos) and six sisters (Tethys, Phoebe, Mnemosyne, Theia, Themis, Rhea). They married each other and gave birth to new gods, including Prometheus, Epimetheus, Atlas, Helios, Selene, Eos, Leto. Uranus sent the most powerful children, Cyclopes and Hecatoncheires, back to the Earth's depths. Suffering greatly, Gaia turned to her Titan sons for help. Only Kronos responded, castrated Uranus, and took his place as supreme deity. Fearing for his power, Kronos swallowed his own children, but Zeus, saved by Rhea, forced him to regurgitate them. The gods, led by Zeus, waged a brutal war with the Titans (Titanomachy) that lasted for ten years. Ultimately, Zeus and the Olympian gods defeated the Titans and cast them into Tartarus."
