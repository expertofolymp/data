            "description": "Titans (τιτᾶνες), in Greek mythology, the gods of the 1st generation, born of Gaia and Uranus. 6 brothers (Oceanus, Koi, Krius, Hyperion, Iapetus, Kronos) and 6 sisters (Tethys, Phoebe, Mnemosyne, Theia, Themis, Rhea), having married each other, gave birth to new gods (Prometheus, Epimetheus, Atlanteus, Helios, Selene, Eos, Leto, etc.). Uranus sent back to the bowels of the Earth the most powerful children (Cyclopes and Hecatonheirs – hundred-armed giants). Suffering greatly, Gaia turned to her titan sons for help. Only Kronos responded to his mother's request, castrated Uranus with an iron sickle and took the place of the supreme deity. Fearing for his power, Kronos swallowed his own children born to Rhea. Saved by cunning, Zeus forced Kronos to regurgitate his brothers and sisters (Poseidon, Hades, Hera, Demeter, Hestia) from the womb and engaged in battle with the Titans. The gods, led by Zeus, strengthened on Olympus (the Olympian gods), the Titans (except for the Ocean) – on the Ophrian mountain. A brutal war (titanomachy) lasted for 10 years. On the advice of Gaia, Zeus released from prison the Cyclopes that Perun forged for him, and the Hecatonheirs, who rained down a hail of huge stones on the Titans. During the great battle, the earth trembled to the depths of the underworld, the seas boiled, even Chaos was enveloped in heat. The victory was won by the Olympian gods. The defeated Titans were cast down into Tartarus, where Zeus put a hundred giants to guard them."
